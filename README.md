# Full Stack App

This is the final project for the Javascript Full Stack Techdegree through Treehouse.

It contains both a client-side, single page application built using React as well as a server-side Api built using Express and REST methodology. 

To run this project, download all files and then cd into the client directory and api directory in separate command prompt/terminal windows and run `npm start` on both. 
The client will run on localhost:3000 and the api will run on localhost:5000.

The application itself is a simple app that allows the user to view all courses created by the user base, sign up for their own login and begin adding courses of their own. They can update/delete their own courses as well.
